# Open and Compact Model for the German energy trasition - OCGModel

Welcome to the Open and Compact  Model for the German energy trasition (OCGModel)! 


This repository contains:

(i) An ["easy-to-read" excel file](/database/database.xlsx) with all model parameters including sources and notes at the database folder;

(ii) The Apache-2.0 licensed source-code of the model implementation using the Open Source Energy Modelling System ([OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org)). 
The interface can be found at the folder [int4osemosys](/int4osemosys). Where the respective README file gives more information on how to obtain and run the model.

(iii) The [OCGModel and int4osemosys documentation](/docs/OCGModel_docs.pdf) at the docs folder.

You can find a complete description of the model structure,  assumptions and validation results at the [Original Paper](https://www.google.de)

	ABSTRACT = {We present an easily accessible model for dispatch and expansion planning of the German multi-modal energy system from today until 2050. The model can be used with low efforts while comparing favorably with historic data and other studies of future developments. More specifically, the model is based on a linear programming partial equilibrium framework and uses a compact set of technologies to ease the comprehension for new modelers. It contains all equations and parameters needed, with the data sources and model assumptions documented in detail. All code and data are openly accessible and usable. The model can reproduce today&rsquo;s energy mix and its CO2 emissions with deviations below 10%. The generated energy transition path, for an 80% CO2 reduction scenario until 2050, is consistent with leading studies on this topic. Our work thus summarizes the key insights of previous works and can serve as a validated and ready-to-use platform for other modelers to examine additional hypotheses.},
